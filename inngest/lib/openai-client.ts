 * - Use Structured Outputs (zodResponseFormat) for type-safe responses
 *
 * Environment:
 * - Requires OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable
 * - Configure in Vercel/Inngest dashboard
 *
 * Models Used:
 * - gpt-5-mini: Fast and cost-effective for content generation
 * - Can be swapped to gpt-4 for higher quality if needed
