/**
 * Save Results to Convex - Final Persistence Step
 *
 * This function is called at the end of the Inngest workflow to persist all
 * AI-generated content to Convex in a single atomic operation.
 *
 * Workflow Context:
 * - Called after 6 parallel AI generation jobs complete
 * - Receives all generated content as a single object
 * - Saves everything in one Convex mutation (atomic update)
 * - Marks project as "completed" to trigger UI state change
 *
 * Design Decision: Single mutation vs. multiple mutations
 * - Pro: Atomic - all content appears together (no partial states in UI)
 * - Pro: One database transaction = faster and more reliable
 * - Pro: Simpler error handling (all or nothing)
 * - Con: Slight delay before UI updates (waits for all jobs)
 * - Trade-off: Better UX consistency over incremental updates
 *
 * Real-time Flow:
 * 1. This mutation updates Convex
 * 2. Convex broadcasts update to all subscribers
 * 3. React components (useQuery) automatically re-render
 * 4. UI shows all new content immediately

/**

 *
 * Two-Step Process:
 * 1. Save all generated content (atomic update, optional fields allowed)
 * 2. Update project status to "completed"
 *
 * Why two separate mutations?
 * - saveGeneratedContent handles optional fields (some may be missing on error)
 * - updateProjectStatus is a separate concern (status management)
 * - Easier to track which step failed if error occurs
 *
 * @param projectId - Convex project ID
 * @param results - All generated content from parallel AI jobs (some may be undefined)
