/**
 * Convex Client Provider
 *
 * Wraps the application with Convex real-time database client.
 * Integrates Clerk authentication with Convex for secure, authenticated queries.
 *
 * Convex + Clerk Integration:
 * - ConvexProviderWithClerk automatically passes Clerk JWT to Convex
 * - Convex validates JWT against auth.config.ts settings
 * - useQuery/useMutation hooks have access to user identity
 * - Server-side functions (mutations/queries) can access ctx.auth
 *
 * Real-time Reactivity:
 * - All components using useQuery automatically re-render on data changes
 * - No polling, no manual cache invalidation required
 * - Optimistic updates supported out of the box
 *
 * Setup:
 * - Wrap app in layout.tsx with this provider
 * - Must be inside Clerk's ClerkProvider
 * - NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL environment variable required
